# Code of Conduct and Brand Guidelines

This section defines the standards of behavior and brand representation expected from all Cellframe Ambassadors. All ambassadors are expected to operate with integrity, responsibility, and alignment with Cellframe's values.

---

## General Guidelines

Ambassadors must:

* Maintain integrity and accuracy in all public statements
* Practice respectful moderation, avoiding personal disputes or unnecessary arguments
* Use official brand assets only, or obtain prior approval for any custom materials
* Disclose potential conflicts of interest or relevant external affiliations
* Avoid any form of market manipulation, token speculation, or financial promises
* Treat community members, other projects, and representatives with respect, maintaining professional and diplomatic communication
* Actively contribute to the growth of their local community, including translation, education, and onboarding of new members
* Represent Cellframe's mission, tone, and values consistently across all platforms

This code exists to protect both the credibility of the project and the reputation of its ambassadors.

### Offboarding and Suspension

The program includes clear rules for temporary suspension or permanent removal to ensure fairness, transparency, and long term sustainability.

#### Grounds for Suspension or Removal

Removal may occur in cases of:

* Prolonged inactivity
* Breach of the code of conduct
* Repeated dissemination of misinformation and FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt).
* Poor representation of the Cellframe brand
* Failure to meet reporting or participation standards
* Disrespectful behavior toward the community, staff, or other ambassadors

---

#### Offboarding Process

Whenever possible, the process follows these steps:

1. **Formal warning**

Initial notification of the issue and expectations for corrective action.

2. **Probation period**

A defined period during which performance and compliance are monitored.

3. **Removal with written notice**

If issues are not resolved, formal removal is issued with written notice.

In severe cases, immediate removal may occur.

---

#### Handover and Access

Upon removal or exit, ambassadors are expected to cooperate with a clean transition, including:

* Handover of access to social channels
* Delivery of content produced on behalf of the project
* Transfer of relevant community assets

---

#### Reapplication

Reapplication may be allowed after review, once conduct and participation standards are met again. Approval is not automatic.

### FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need prior experience to participate?**

No. The program is open to new contributors who want to learn and participate.

**When do I start earning points?**

After completing the required training and being officially activated in the program.

**What if I join in the middle of a Season?**

You may participate normally, but your evaluation will be proportional to the time you were active during that Season.

**Am I required to participate every month?**

No. Participation is voluntary. However, inactive months or missing reports do not generate rewards and may affect continuity in the program.

**What happens if I do not submit my monthly report?**

No report means no validation.

No validation means no reward for that Season.

**Can I participate in more than one category?**

Not simultaneously. Each ambassador operates in one category per Season.

**Who decides promotions or category changes?**

Decisions are made by the Program Lead in coordination with the core team, based on data, performance history, and strategic needs.

**Where can I track my metrics?**

Official tools, forms, and dashboards will be communicated through the program's official channels.

**Are rewards guaranteed?**

No. Rewards are always conditional on verified performance, quality, and compliance with program rules.

**Can I leave the program at any time?**

Yes. Participation is voluntary.

### Final Note

The Cellframe Ambassador Program is designed to reward **real contribution**, not symbolic presence.

Those who deliver value grow.

Those who do not, simply do not progress.
