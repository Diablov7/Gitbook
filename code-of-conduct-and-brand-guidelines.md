## General Guidelines

Ambassadors must:

* Practice respectful moderation, avoiding personal disputes or unnecessary arguments
* Use official brand assets only, or obtain prior approval for any custom materials
* Disclose potential conflicts of interest or relevant external affiliations

This code exists to protect both the credibility of the project and the reputation of its ambassadors.
