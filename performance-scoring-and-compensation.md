# Performance Scoring and Compensation

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Design sem nome (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## How Performance Turns Into Rewards

The Cellframe Ambassador Program does not reward presence. It rewards measurable contribution.

Compensation is distributed through a points based model combined with fixed monthly pools. Each activity has a defined weight. The more relevant and verified value you deliver, the larger your share of the pool.

This module explains:

- How points are earned per activity
- What the hard caps are
- How points convert into USD
- How the Effective Pool works
- How the 100 point multiplier works

## Seasons & Evaluation Cycles

The Cellframe Ambassador Program operates in monthly Seasons.

Each Season represents a complete evaluation cycle, including activity execution, performance measurement, scoring, and reward distribution.

Points, leaderboards, and eligibility reset at the beginning of every Season.

### Threshold Progression by Season

During the first two Seasons, a reduced eligibility threshold of 30 points may be applied to support onboarding and adaptation.

From Season 3 onward, the standard eligibility threshold of 40 points applies.

### Why Seasons Matter

Treating each month as a Season reinforces performance based participation. Rewards are earned per Season, not accumulated by tenure.

## The Season Performance Cycle

1. **Ambassadors execute activities aligned with their category**

Ambassadors perform the activities expected for their category throughout the month.

2. **Activities are tracked**

Tracking is performed via bots, tools, and manual validation.

3. **Monthly activity report submission**

A monthly activity report is submitted. No report means no points.

4. **Points are assigned**

Points are assigned per activity category based on the rules for each category.

5. **Eligible ambassadors share the pool**

Eligible ambassadors share the Effective Pool proportionally based on Weighted_Points.

**No report means no points. No points means no payment.**

## Effective Pool Model

### Why it exists

If the category underdelivers, it is not fair for the same category to drain the entire Monthly Pool.

The Effective Pool model makes distribution proportional to how much the category collectively delivered.

### Step 1: Compute the category average performance ratio

For each eligible ambassador (Points_i >= Threshold):

```
Performance_Ratio_i = Points_i / 100
```

Then:

```
Average_Performance_Ratio = (Sum of all Performance_Ratio_i for eligible only) / N_eligible
```

**Important**: Only eligible ambassadors (those who meet the minimum threshold) are included in this calculation. Non-eligible ambassadors do not affect the Effective Pool.

### Step 2: Compute the Effective Pool

```
Effective_Pool = Monthly_Pool × Average_Performance_Ratio
```

Only the Effective Pool is distributed. The remainder stays reserved.

```
Reserved_Amount = Monthly_Pool − Effective_Pool
```

### Practical result

- **High performance month**: most of the pool is distributed
- **Low performance month**: a large portion stays reserved

This pushes the category to improve, without needing drama or subjective decisions.

## Excellence Multiplier for 100 Point Performers

### Why it exists

In large groups, being the only person to hit 100 points can still produce a weak payout if the rest of the category underdelivers.

To keep excellence meaningful, 100 point performers can receive a multiplier applied to their points only for payment weighting.

### Recommended rule

If `Points_i = 100`, then:

```
Weighted_Points_i = Points_i × M
```

Where M is typically 1.25.

If `Points_i < 100`:

```
Weighted_Points_i = Points_i
```

Distribution uses Weighted_Points, but the Effective Pool still uses real points for performance ratio. That keeps the system honest.

## Payment Formula (Final)

1. **Filter eligible ambassadors**

Only ambassadors who meet eligibility (points threshold, valid report, verified activity) are considered for the entire payment calculation.

2. **Compute the Effective_Pool**

Calculate Average_Performance_Ratio using only eligible ambassadors, then compute `Effective_Pool = Monthly_Pool × Average_Performance_Ratio`.

3. **Compute Weighted_Points for distribution**

Apply the Excellence Multiplier to any 100-point performers; others keep their points as-is.

4. **Compute individual payments**

```
Payment_i = (Weighted_Points_i / Total_Weighted_Points_Eligible) × Effective_Pool
```

## Examples

**Note**: All examples below show only eligible ambassadors (those meeting the threshold). Non-eligible ambassadors are excluded from all calculations.

### Example A: 10 Regional Ambassadors, Monthly Pool USD 1,000

Only 2 hit 100 points. The other 8 are below 60.

**Assume:**

- 2 ambassadors: 100 pts
- 4 ambassadors: 50 pts
- 4 ambassadors: 40 pts

**Average performance ratio**: (1.0 + 1.0 + (0.5 × 4) + (0.4 × 4)) / 10

(2.0 + 2.0 + 1.6) / 10 = 5.6 / 10 = 0.56

**Effective Pool**: 1000 × 0.56 = USD 560  
**Reserved** = USD 440

If multiplier M = 1.25:

- Each 100 pt becomes 125 weighted points
- Total weighted points: (125 × 2) + (50 × 4) + (40 × 4)
- 250 + 200 + 160 = 610

**Payouts:**

- 100 pt performer: (125 / 610) × 560 ≈ USD 114.75 each
- 50 pt performer: (50 / 610) × 560 ≈ USD 45.90 each
- 40 pt performer: (40 / 610) × 560 ≈ USD 36.72 each

### Example B: 25 Regional Ambassadors, Monthly Pool USD 700

Only 1 person hits 100 points. The other 24 are below 100.

**Assume:**

- 1 ambassador: 100 pts
- 6 ambassadors: 70 pts
- 10 ambassadors: 50 pts
- 8 ambassadors: 40 pts

**Average performance ratio**: (1.0 + (0.7 × 6) + (0.5 × 10) + (0.4 × 8)) / 25

(1.0 + 4.2 + 5.0 + 3.2) / 25 = 13.4 / 25 = 0.536

**Effective Pool**: 700 × 0.536 = USD 375.20  
**Reserved** = USD 324.80

Apply multiplier M = 1.25 to the 100 pt performer:

- 100 pts → 125 weighted points
- Total weighted points: 125 + (70 × 6) + (50 × 10) + (40 × 8)
- 125 + 420 + 500 + 320 = 1365

**Payouts:**

- 100 pt performer: (125 / 1365) × 375.20 ≈ USD 34.36
- 70 pt performer: (70 / 1365) × 375.20 ≈ USD 19.25 each
- 50 pt performer: (50 / 1365) × 375.20 ≈ USD 13.74 each
- 40 pt performer: (40 / 1365) × 375.20 ≈ USD 10.99 each

## Two Extreme Scenarios (Stress Tests)

### Stress Test 1: Very strong month

- 25 ambassadors
- Average points = 90
- Monthly Pool = USD 700
- Average ratio = 0.90
- Effective Pool = 700 × 0.90 = USD 630
- Reserved = USD 70

**Result**: almost the whole pool is distributed, because the category performed.

### Stress Test 2: Very weak month

- 6 ambassadors
- Only 1 hits 100
- 1 hits 80
- Everyone else averages 60
- Monthly Pool = USD 300
- Average ratio = (1.0 + 0.8 + (0.6 × 4)) / 6
- (1.0 + 0.8 + 2.4) / 6 = 4.2 / 6 = 0.70
- Effective Pool = 300 × 0.70 = USD 210.00
- Reserved = USD 90.00

**Result**: the category cannot drain the full pool on a weak month.

## Important Clarifications

- Points reset every month.
- Hard caps are enforced to prevent metric abuse.
- Manual validation overrides automation whenever quality is questionable.
- Cellframe reserves the right to invalidate low quality, artificial, or manipulated activity.

## Reserved Pool & Rebase Logic

Any undistributed portion of the Monthly Pool becomes a Reserved Pool.

The Reserved Pool is carried forward to the next season.

In the following month, the protocol only tops up the pool to reach the Effective Pool unlocked by collective performance.

This creates a balanced rebase mechanism where strong performance unlocks higher rewards, and weak performance naturally reduces spending without penalizing contributors.

## Eligibility and Threshold Handling

Ambassadors who fail to meet the minimum eligibility threshold do not receive payments for the month.

**Their performance is NOT included in the category's average performance calculation.** Only eligible ambassadors are considered when determining how much of the Monthly Pool is unlocked through the Effective Pool calculation. This ensures that non-eligible ambassadors do not reduce the pool available to those who met the threshold.

## Final Note

This model is intentionally strict.

It rewards consistency, quality, and real impact. Spam, shortcuts, and artificial engagement do not survive this system.
