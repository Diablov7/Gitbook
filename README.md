## Cellframe Ambassador Program

The Cellframe Ambassador Program is a structured, performance driven framework created to support the global growth of the Cellframe ecosystem through influence, community expansion, and coordinated grassroots execution.

The program exists to **identify, train, activate, and scale contributors who generate real and measurable impact**. It is not a passive rewards system, not a social badge, and not a guarantee of compensation. Participation is conditional on training completion, delivery, accountability, and alignment with Cellframe’s long term vision.

Ambassadors operate within clearly defined categories designed to reflect different types of contribution. These categories separate influence, execution, and engagement to ensure that contributors are evaluated and rewarded based on the value they actually deliver. Detailed roles, responsibilities, and governance rules are defined in the **Program Structure** section.

All participants begin with a structured training process to align expectations, standards, and understanding of Cellframe’s technology, narrative, and operating model. Training enables participation, but only consistent performance sustains progression and rewards.

The program runs in monthly cycles called **Seasons**. Each Season functions as an independent evaluation period where activity is tracked, performance is measured, and rewards are distributed based on verified results. Points reset every Season, reinforcing a continuous performance mindset.

This framework is designed to scale contribution, not entitlement. Rewards are earned through measurable impact, quality execution, and consistent alignment. Contributors who deliver value progress naturally. Those who do not are filtered out by design.
