# Program Structure

## Why a Tiered Structure Exists

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Cellframe Ambassador Program is intentionally designed as a tiered system to balance scale, quality, and accountability.

Not all contributions generate the same type of value. Influence, execution, and engagement require different skills, levels of trust, and time commitments. A flat structure would either dilute standards or limit growth.

The tiered model allows Cellframe to:

* Scale participation without sacrificing quality
* Match responsibility to proven capability
* Reward contributors proportionally to real impact
* Preserve credibility, especially in public facing roles

Each tier exists to solve a specific growth problem within the ecosystem.

## Program Philosophy

The program is built to scale contribution, not participation.

Titles are not permanent. Status is not symbolic. Responsibility, access, and rewards increase only in proportion to verified value delivered over time.

There are no automatic promotions and no entitlement based on visibility, seniority, or time served. Participation is voluntary. Accountability is mandatory.

Progression is earned through verified results and ongoing, demonstrable value - not tenure or visibility alone.

## General Operating Principles

### Merit Based Progression

Progression between tiers is earned through consistent delivery, verified results, and demonstrated reliability.

Promotions are discretionary and depend on performance history, impact quality, available capacity, budget constraints, and strategic priorities. Past contributions do not guarantee future status.

### Data Driven and Quality First Evaluation

Performance is evaluated using objective data wherever possible, combined with qualitative validation.

Low quality, repetitive, artificially generated, or botted activity is discounted or ignored. Organic engagement and real traction are prioritized at all levels.

### Clear Role Separation

Each tier has a clearly defined scope to avoid overlap, confusion, and misaligned expectations.

* Core Ambassadors focus on influence, credibility, and public representation.
* Regional Ambassadors focus on execution, coordination, and sustainable community growth.
* Rising Ambassadors focus on engagement, learning, and early stage contribution.

Ambassadors are evaluated strictly on criteria relevant to their assigned tier.

## Ambassador Tiers Overview

---

### <u><span style="color: white;">**Core Ambassadors**</span></u>

**Why This Tier Exists**

To represent Cellframe publicly through trusted individuals with real influence, organic reach, and proven credibility. This tier protects the project's narrative and reputation in high visibility environments.

**Selection Process**

Core Ambassadors are selected directly by the team from among program applicants. All candidates submitted an application form. The team then extends invitations to individuals who meet the strategic requirements for high-impact public representation based on their demonstrated influence, credibility, and alignment with Cellframe's values.

**Selection Criteria**

* Proven organic engagement and real audience interaction
* Verified non botted followers and healthy engagement ratios
* Relevant reach within specific regions, languages, or sectors
* Demonstrated alignment with Cellframe's values and narrative

Follower count alone is never sufficient. Quality of audience and authenticity are mandatory.

**Scope**

* High impact public representation
* Strategic amplification and positioning
* Media, events, and partnership exposure
* Direct alignment with the core team

Core Ambassadors are not community managers.

### <u><span style="color: white;">**Regional Ambassadors**</span></u>

**Why This Tier Exists**

To transform organic interest into structured, healthy regional growth. This tier exists where local demand justifies dedicated ownership.

**Selection Process**

Regional Ambassadors are selected by the team based on regional demand. When the team identifies that a community is growing to the point where it requires a local ambassador, candidates are invited to join based on either:
* Their submitted application form, or
* Promotion from the Rising Ambassadors tier based on demonstrated performance and regional fit

All candidates have submitted an application form to be considered. Selection is driven by actual need: high-demand regions may justify new onboardings, while low-demand regions may not.

**Selection Logic**

* Onboarding is driven by regional demand and growth signals
* Priority is given to long term contributors and OG community members
* Historical engagement, reliability, and time in the ecosystem matter
* Regional credibility outweighs raw activity volume

High demand regions may justify new onboardings. Low demand regions may not.

**Scope**

* Community growth, retention, and health
* Localized education and content
* Coordination of regional initiatives and campaigns
* Day to day community support

### <u><span style="color: white;">**Rising Ambassadors**</span></u>

**Why This Tier Exists**

To create a scalable entry point for new contributors who want to learn, participate, and prove their value over time.

This tier is intentionally open and dynamic. It functions as both an onboarding layer and a filtering mechanism.

**Selection Process**

Rising Ambassadors include all individuals who have applied to the program and are interested in representing the Cellframe ecosystem. This tier includes all applicants who demonstrate genuine interest and commitment to learning about and contributing to Cellframe.

**Compensation**

Rising Ambassadors are fairly compensated according to:
* The budget allocated by the project
* The individual candidate's effort and performance

Rewards are distributed through the performance-based scoring system, ensuring that compensation reflects actual contribution and value delivered.

**Profile**

* New or early stage community members
* Strong interest in learning about Cellframe and the ecosystem
* Willingness to engage consistently and follow guidance

**Progression Logic**

Rising Ambassadors can be promoted based on demonstrated traction, quality, and impact.

Depending on the nature of their contribution, promotions may lead to:

* Regional Ambassador roles, when execution and local leadership are demonstrated
* Core Ambassador roles, when influence, reach, and public impact justify it

There is no fixed promotion path. Impact defines direction.

## Governance & Authority

**Accountability and Enforcement**

Failure to meet minimum standards, submit required reports, or comply with program rules may result in loss of eligibility for compensation, tier downgrade, or removal from the program.

All tiers are subject to review and enforcement.

**Program Adjustments**

Cellframe reserves the right to modify program rules, metrics, compensation structures, eligibility thresholds, and tier definitions at any time. Adjustments may reflect strategic priorities, budget constraints, regional demand, or abuse prevention.

No role, metric, or reward is guaranteed or permanent.

**Final Authority**

All interpretations of program rules, tier definitions, evaluation outcomes, and assignments are made by the Program Lead in coordination with the core team.

These decisions are final and executed in the best interest of the Cellframe ecosystem.
